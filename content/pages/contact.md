## Want to work with me?

Here are a few things I look for in new projects.

* Working with top computer languages and frameworks such as Clojure, Racket,
  Elixir, or Rust.
    
* Focus on an interesting and important work domain such as education tooling,
    or reproductive rights.
    
* Joining a team with a culture of catalyzing and unblocking each other and
    caring for the future through sustainable practices like maintaining
    documentation, building robust APIs, URIs, and database schemas, and
    minimizing the carbon impact of our work by investing in a remote work
    culture.
    
Does this team sound like one that you're building or want to build?
