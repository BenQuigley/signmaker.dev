Welcome!
I'm Ben, and this is my home on the internet.

* üï∑Ô∏è Software developer (Python, GraphQL, REST, databases)
* üî• Climate activist
* ‚ôä Twin parent
* ü•ß Baking & cooking enthusiast
* üé∏ Folk fingerstyle guitarist
* ‚úèÔ∏è Novice artist

I'm a software developer coming to you from  [Warner Bros. Digital
Labs](https://www.warnerbros.com/) working on
[DCUniverse.com](https://dcuniverse.com) and other high-traffic and -visibility
webapps, at [EditShare](https://editshare.com/) writing high-performance Python
code for video servers, and most recently at
[EquityZen.com](https://equityzen.com/), developing performant GraphQL APIs and
data pipelines supporting a top-tier investment application.

## Want to work with me?

Here are a few things I look for in new projects.

* Working with top computer languages and frameworks such as Clojure, Racket,
  Elixir, or Rust.
    
* Focus on an interesting and important work domain such as education tooling,
    or reproductive rights.
    
* Joining a team with a culture of catalyzing and unblocking each other and
    caring for the future through sustainable practices like maintaining
    documentation, building robust APIs, URIs, and database schemas, and
    minimizing the carbon impact of our work by investing in a remote work
    culture.
    
Does this team sound like one that you're building or want to build?

## About signmaker.dev

One of my favorite characters is  [the Sign
Painter](https://worldofgoo.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sign_Painter) from the puzzle
game [World of Goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Goo). I call my site
[signmaker.dev](https://signmaker.dev) because putting up signs (or labels, web
sites, code comments...) is a pro-social, semantically deep act that can have
profound consequences in a system. As you might expect, I own a label maker and
know how to use it.

On a less philosophical note, this site is made with open-source
software:

* it is build using [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican)

* and a [theme](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex) created by
    [Alexander Revicenzi](https://www.alexandrevicenzi.com/),
    
* and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
