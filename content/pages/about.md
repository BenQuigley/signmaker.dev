webapps, and from [EditShare](https://editshare.com/) writing high-performance
Python code for video servers, and currently from

## About signmaker.dev

"signmaker" is an old screen name. One of my favorite characters is [the Sign
Painter](https://worldofgoo.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sign_Painter) from the puzzle
game [World of Goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Goo). I call my site
[signmaker.dev](https://signmaker.dev) because putting up signs (or labels, web
sites, code comments...) is a pro-social, semantically deep act that can have
profound consequences in a system. As you might expect, I own a label maker and
know how to use it.

On a less philosophical note, this site is made with open-source
software:

* it is built using [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican)

* and a [theme](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex) forked from
    [Alexander Revicenzi](https://www.alexandrevicenzi.com/),

* and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
