    <p>I&#8217;m now the owner of Malinconia #103, so since there are so few of them out in the wild, and being
that it cost around $400, I thought I&#8217;d better tell you what it&#8217;s&nbsp;like.</p>
<p><img alt="My pedalboard showing the TEFI Malinconia" src="images/malinconia-pedalboard.jpg"></p>
<p>I love lo-fi music in general, and lo-fi guitar pedals have always had a special place in my heart,
ever since the <span class="caps">ZVEX</span> Instant Lofi Junky became only the third guitar pedal I ever owned. Excluding
&#8220;lo-fi delay&#8221; and &#8220;reverb&#8221; effects like the Digitech Obscura or Caroline Météore, and also not
counting effects like the Strymon Deco which are &#8220;vintage&#8221; or maybe nostalgic but not exactly in the
&#8220;warbly lo-fi&#8221; genre that I&#8217;m most fond of, I&#8217;ve still owned quite a&nbsp;few:</p>

<li>and now the <a href="https://tefivintagelab.it/"><span class="caps">TEFI</span> Vintage Lab&nbsp;Malinconia</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s give each of these some brief discussion and a rating. The ratings will go on a scale from 1
to 4 in honor of Roger Ebert. Factors that I care about include beautifulness, composability with
other effects / subtlety, return-on-investment with regard to price, and <span class="caps">ROI</span> with regard to amperage
from my pedalboard. Let&#8217;s go in the order in which I tried&nbsp;them.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">ZVEX</span> Instant Lofi&nbsp;Junky</h2>
<p>I mentioned that I&#8217;m nostalgic for this pedal since it was one of my first ones, but it&#8217;s a pretty
boozy effect. There is no subtlety possible with the Lofi Junky whatsoever. It does sound nice.&nbsp;2/4.</p>
<h2>Fairfield Shallow&nbsp;Water</h2>
<p>This is a darling of the boutique effect pedals community, and the trademark Fairfield minimalist
design is gorgeous and works well for the lo-fi theme, but when it comes to sound, something about
it just hurts my ears. There&#8217;s a guy named Knobs whose (wonderful)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYWuTmgVU9k">review</a> of this pedal calls it &#8220;the water bed of the
heart&#8221;, but to me it just sounds like my amp is trapped inside a water bed. Like the Lofi Junky, my
experience is that this pedal is also not capable of subtlety at all; it&#8217;s either off or it is a
huge, wet blanket on top of your tone.&nbsp;2/4.</p>
<h2>Walrus Mako&nbsp;M1</h2>
<p>The M1 is problematic but kind of great. It does a lot, delivering chorus, phaser, tremolo, vibrato,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_speaker">rotary</a>, and filter&nbsp;effects.</p>
<p>Actually, it comes with 3 subvarieties of each of those six effect classes, each of which is
distinct and&nbsp;interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chorus<ul>
<li>Traditional&nbsp;Chorus</li>
<li>Series&nbsp;Chorus</li>
<li>Tri-Chorus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phaser<ul>
<li>2-Stage&nbsp;Phaser</li>
<li>4-Stage&nbsp;Phaser</li>
<li>Univibe Tuned&nbsp;Phaser</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tremolo<ul>
<li>Traditional&nbsp;Tremolo</li>
<li>Harmonic&nbsp;Tremolo</li>
<li>Pattern&nbsp;Tremolo</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vibrato<ul>
<li>Traditional&nbsp;Vibrato</li>
<li>Vinyl&nbsp;Vibrato</li>
<li>Tape&nbsp;Vibrato</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rotary<ul>
<li>Horn + Drum (Traditional Rotary&nbsp;Speaker)</li>
<li>Horn&nbsp;Only</li>
<li>Drum&nbsp;Only</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Filter<ul>
<li>Lowpass&nbsp;Filter</li>
<li>Highpass&nbsp;Filter</li>
<li>Bandpass&nbsp;Filter</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus it has a &#8220;lo-fi&#8221; knob that controls six additional effects: &#8220;env&#8221; (tone jumps responding to how
hard you play), &#8220;drive&#8221;, &#8220;space&#8221; (reverb), &#8220;age&#8221; (a tape age effect), &#8220;noise&#8221;, and &#8220;warble&#8221;. Plus
there are six modulation parameters, plus the pedal supports presets&#8230; The pedal is a case study in
how hard it is to design an effect pedal&#8217;s physical&nbsp;interface.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit bananas and, like the other two I&#8217;ve discussed so far, a huge tone suck (in most
configurations). Also, it requires a lot of power (300 mA minimum).&nbsp;But:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#8220;univibe-tuned phaser&#8221; setting rocks; it&#8217;s no worse than the Strymon Ultraviolet which costs
  basically as much as this pedal&nbsp;does</li>
<li>The chorus (especially the trichorus) isn&#8217;t&nbsp;bad</li>
<li>The out-of-the-box presets give you a great way to explore all this and easily switch between them
  all, once you learn how to use&nbsp;them</li>
<li>The vibrato settings (preset 2-red) with the lo-fi knob turned up a bit are a wonderful lo-fi
  effect, reminiscent of the Lofi Junky and in fact the&nbsp;Malinconia</li>
<li>The harmonic tremolo and 2-stage and 4-stage phaser settings aren&#8217;t bad at&nbsp;all</li>
</ul>
<p>You just get so much for your money (especially now that the M1 mk2 is out, which I&#8217;m not interested
in because I don&#8217;t like pedals with screens). This thing is $200!&nbsp;4/4.</p>
<h2>Chase Bliss Generation Loss&nbsp;mk2</h2>
<p>I was excited about this one, having had great experiences with my other <span class="caps">CBA</span> pedals, and it is
indeed a great&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Chase Bliss is known for - since their typical pedal ships with 6 knobs, 3-5 switches, two buttons,
and 12 or so &#8220;dipswitches&#8221; on the back of the case - making pedals that contain a lot of complexity.
But over time, as I&#8217;ve been playing guitar, I&#8217;ve started to appreciate pedals that I can &#8220;set and
forget&#8221; and that, at a glance, I can have a pretty good idea what it&#8217;s going to sound like when I
step on it and turn it on. The Gen Loss kind of has this property! It&#8217;s an ergonomic, good-sounding
lo-fi&nbsp;pedal.</p>
<p>I just couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about what else that $400 could buy if I sold or traded this pedal.
(The $350 I quoted above is its market rate now, but I pre-ordered the Gen Loss from Chase
themselves, and I think I sold or traded it for about the&nbsp;same). </p>
<p>One of my big complaints about this pedal is that it comes with 12 &#8220;models&#8221; of tape degradation,
each of which has been effortfully crafted (Chase Bliss put out all kinds of great YouTube and
Instagram content showing their capturing sounds from real VCRs and Fisher-Price toys and so on) and
beautifully described in the manual; but the actual knob on the pedal that selects from these 12
models doesn&#8217;t even have tick marks to show which model you have selected. If you want model #4
(&#8220;Desktop-style, all-in-one 4-track recorder&#8221;), you just have to do your best to turn the knob 4/12
of the way through its range and hope you got the right one. What&#8217;s the point of so much specificity
if you&#8217;re never even going to be totally sure what you&#8217;re getting? Why not just label the pedal&#8217;s
range with tick marks, like on the Chase Bliss&nbsp;Thermae?</p>
<p>3/4.</p>
<h2>Kinotone&nbsp;Ribbons</h2>
<p>The Ribbons is a particularly boutique pedal from an up-and-coming studio Kinotone, but it&#8217;s
absolutely packed with features. It&#8217;s not &#8220;just&#8221; a lo-fi pedal, although most of its features
pertain at least loosely to the theme of &#8220;lo-fi and tape&nbsp;emulation&#8221;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely clever <span class="caps">UI</span> design: You know how some pedals, like Red Panda, have a
  &#8220;Shift&#8221; button that adds alternative functions to the knobs? The benefit is
  that you get twice as many knob effects for the same housing. (But the
  drawback is that you can&#8217;t just look at a knob and know for sure what its
  settings is set to, and the Ribbons has this drawback). But the Ribbons
  doesn&#8217;t just have &#8220;secondary&#8221; knob functions; instead it has four &#8220;Pages&#8221; of
  knob functions which you can toggle&nbsp;between.</li>
<li>Additionally it has eight preset slots, with some pretty boozy default
    presets that do a good job of showcasing the different sounds that the pedal
    is capable&nbsp;of.</li>
<li>Additionally it has a four-track looper, which has its own &#8220;Page&#8221; of four
    knobs to control. You can pitch-shift the loops up or down and slow or speed
    them up, like the <span class="caps">CBA</span>&nbsp;Blooper!</li>
<li>Low-pass and high-pass filter&nbsp;knobs</li>
<li>Mix&nbsp;knob</li>
<li>Compressor. Deserves special mention - <span class="caps">REALLY</span> good sounding compression
    effect, comparable to the best other compressor that I have&nbsp;tried.</li>
<li>Wobble depth and rate knobs. This can function as a vibrato or as a chorus
    (if you turn down Mix), and also deserves special mention as a wonderful,
    musical effect that sounds good in loads of different&nbsp;configurations.</li>
<li>Flutter depth and rate knobs.&nbsp;(Meh).</li>
<li>Dropouts depth and rate knobs - &#8220;the effect of tape getting stuck momentarily and then catching&nbsp;up.&#8221;</li>
<li>Crinkle - momentary silences. (No depth <span class="amp">&amp;</span> rate, just one&nbsp;knob.)</li>
<li>Noise - the 7 o&#8217;clock to noon side of this knob gets you a radio static
    sound, whereas the noon to 5 side gets you (delightful) record player&nbsp;pops.</li>
<li>Reverb depth - can be pre-effects (left side of depth knob) or post (right
    side) - and&nbsp;mix</li>
<li>and then the final two knobs control various parameters for the <em>four</em>
    different modes of the pedal&#8217;s second button, which are called Touch Modes. For example (there
    are six total after a firmware update):<ul>
<li>a microlooper similar to the Chase <span class="caps">MOOD</span>&#8217;s &#8220;tape&#8221;&nbsp;effect</li>
<li>a &#8220;tape stop&#8221; effect that&#8217;s also highly configurable and surprisingly musical <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;fun</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was breathless at how much features are packed into this device. I ultimately did not hang on to
it, as for whatever reason, one day, it just no longer sparked joy, but it sets a high bar for both
the high number of its various features and the polished beauty of its sounds.&nbsp;4/4.</p>
<h2>Chase Bliss&nbsp;Lossy</h2>
<p>The Lossy is a lo-fi pedal with a strong theme - &#8220;lo-fi&#8221; based on mp3 / phone-line style degradation
rather than cassette tapes or vinyl records. I played with mine a lot, and it was fun, but at the
end of the day it always made my guitar sound &#8220;worse&#8221; rather than &#8220;nostalgically altered&#8221;. I wished
that it were more configurable, for example, that you could turn up the intensity of the &#8220;packets&#8221;
glitch feature without turning up the quality loss effect; both of these intensities are controlled
by one Loss knob, so it meant that you couldn&#8217;t use the pedal as a &#8220;glitch&#8221; pedal, it was
all-or-nothing, complete degradation. Sure, there was a &#8220;Mix&#8221; knob (labelled &#8220;Global&#8221; on this pedal
for some reason) but, like I said, the best-sounding setting of that knob was all the way&nbsp;off. </p>
<p>The visual aesthetics of the pedal were superb, and the Freeze function was fun, and I liked that it
came with a&nbsp;reverb.</p>
<p>2/4.</p>
<h2>Hologram Chroma&nbsp;Console</h2>
<p>This device is a lot like the Ribbons, except it&#8217;s from Hologram, a very well established and
beloved purveyor of &#8220;big box&#8221; effects suites. Including it in this &#8220;lo-fi pedals review&#8221; is kind of
like including an iPhone in a &#8220;calculators review&#8221; - the Chroma Console also has an overdrive, 
fuzz, phaser, and various &#8220;diffusion&#8221; features that all amount to different sorts of granular /
reverse delay and reverb. Its fourth (of four) section is dedicated to five &#8220;lo-fi&#8221; options, which
it calls &#8220;Texture&#8221;: &#8220;Filter&#8221;, &#8220;Squash&#8221; (compressor), &#8220;Cassette&#8221;, &#8220;Broken&#8221;, and&nbsp;&#8220;Interference&#8221;.</p>
<p>My expectations for this pedal were not actually all that high, on the presumption that a pedal
containing 20 different effects probably contains about 4 good ones. I did not find the Chroma
Console incredibly memorable, but the &#8220;cassette&#8221; mode did sound very good. Also, I tend to find
Hologram interfaces confusing and non-ergonomic (for example, I can&#8217;t remember how to set presets,
or what &#8220;Secondary&#8221; and &#8220;Gesture&#8221; do). I would like to play with it&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>3/4.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">TEFI</span> Vintage Lab&nbsp;Malinconia</h2>
<p>The Malinconia arrived this week, so it&#8217;s possible that I&#8217;m wearing rose-colored lenses when I look
at it, but I do like its sound very well. It&#8217;s a fully analog pedal from Italy whose features&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>two different lo-fi modulation effects, a warbly one labeled &#8220;wow&#8221; and a slower,
  boat-shifting-underneath-you one labeled &#8220;warp&#8221;, both controlled by the same &#8220;rate&#8221;&nbsp;knob.</li>
<li>a filter knob and a bass cut&nbsp;knob</li>
<li>a &#8220;noise&#8221; knob that&#8217;s as silly as every other noise knob on the other pedals in this post (the
  Mako M1, Gen Loss, and Ribbons all also have&nbsp;one)</li>
<li>a &#8220;power&#8221; effect simulating a tube amplifier&#8217;s saturation point (fun, well implemented, good&nbsp;sounding)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing it and really especially enjoying the &#8220;warp&#8221;. I love a slow, emotional modulation&nbsp;effect.</p>
<p>Is it an &#8220;always on&#8221; effect? No, and in fact I would say that the effect&#8217;s &#8220;beautifulness&#8221; - it is
extremely melancholy and beautiful - but it is not <strong><em>that</em></strong> different from that of the Mako M1&#8217;s &#8220;Trad
Vibrato&#8221; preset (with the lo-fi knob turned up and the rate turned down), a pedal that costs half as
much as the&nbsp;Malinconia.</p>
<p>One feature is worth mentioning, though, and while it&#8217;s a bit anticlimactic in terms of
interestingness, it might be the make-or-break feature that ~~allows~~ persuades me to keep the
Malinconia around: its <em>amperage</em> cost is a third of the Mako M1. (Probably this is because the
Malinconia is a fully analog pedal and the M1 is basically a tiny signal-processing computer). I run
my pedals out of a <a href="https://truetone.com/cs12/">Truetone 1 <span class="caps">SPOT</span> Pro <span class="caps">CS</span> 12</a>, which has nine 9V <span class="caps">DC</span>
power outputs (each of which can support one pedal): five at 100 mA, two at 250 mA, and two at 500
mA. So, while I can have as many as nine pedals on my board without involving external power
supplies or converters for the 18V outputs, <em>in practice</em>, it can be hard to make room for a pedal
that <em>requires</em> one of the 500 mA outputs, because there are only two of them and I have a mighty
need for fancy loopers, delays, and ambient reverb in addition to a &#8220;lo-fi&#8221; pedal or&nbsp;two.</p>
