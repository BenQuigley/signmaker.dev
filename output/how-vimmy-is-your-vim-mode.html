  <div>
    <p>It&#8217;s common for online code editors (LeetCode, CoderPad, CodeSignal, etc.) to offer &#8220;Vim and Emacs
modes,&#8221; and since I&#8217;m most comfortable working with the Vim keybinds, I usually turn them on. When I
sat down for a technical interview the other day and attempted to use the Vim features that my hands
take for granted, however, I ran into some behaviors I didn&#8217;t expect - features misbehaving such as
visual-mode find and replace, interactive find and replace, and even jumping from one parenthesis to
its partner with <code>%</code>.</p>
<p>I wondered how complete these online &#8220;Vim modes&#8221; really are, and I took it upon myself to create a
rubric and begin to assign&nbsp;scores.</p>
<h2>Caveats:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I access the web via up-to-date Firefox with <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> and
  <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">PrivacyBadger</a>. From time to time a web site does not work as
  expected by its designers with this setup. When a Vim feature appeared to &#8220;try to work&#8221; but was
  broken in my testing, I noted it as &#8220;broken&#8221; rather than &#8220;missing&#8221;, but I didn&#8217;t investigate the
  cause of the failure&nbsp;further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I fully concede that just because a web site advertises a &#8220;Vim mode&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean it has promised
  to ship a fully functional Vim! I&#8217;m not trying to roast these sites for not having these features.
  I&#8217;m only exploring what Vim features are and are not present in these editors&#8217; Vim modes, just
  because I am&nbsp;curious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My assignment of &#8220;importance points&#8221; to the various Vim features that I discussed are obviously
  arbitrary, as are the categories themselves, and no doubt there are important Vim features that I
  failed to test. (No doubt there are important Vim features that I don&#8217;t even know&nbsp;about!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn&#8217;t test Vim features that don&#8217;t make sense in the context of a non-Vim <span class="caps">IDE</span>, such as netrw (its directory
  explorer, <code>:Explore</code>), splitting panes, and opening&nbsp;tabs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are inevitably some idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies. I had to make judgment calls about
  how forgiving to be. For example, I gave no points to HackerRank when finding that jumping from a
  parenthesis to its partner only works forwards in its editor; when finding, however, that
  Neetcode.io editor&#8217;s visual block mode works to some extent, but doesn&#8217;t allow replacing in the
  visual block with <code>r</code> as Vim does, I awarded points for that feature anyway since (to me) 95% of
  the feature&#8217;s utility was&nbsp;there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the Emacs keybinds well enough to grade them, sorry! If you want to hit me with a
  rubric of desired features and instructions for testing, I&#8217;d be happy to collaborate on a
  follow-up blog&nbsp;post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methodology:</h2>
<p>I decided on thirteen semi-important (at least, I use them all regularly) but non-trivial Vim
features to test. I assigned them &#8220;importance points&#8221; based on my subjective judgment of how often I
guessed I used&nbsp;them.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Importance points</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Deleting something pops it into your &#8220;paste&#8221; buffer</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Selecting (visual mode) inside parentheses with <code>v i (</code></td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Repeating a recent action with <code>.</code></td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Doing <code>{number} {action}</code> does <code>{action}</code> that many times</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Visual block mode</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>/</code> searches</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jumping from a parenthesis to its partner with %</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>:%s</code> and <code>:s</code> find and replace</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interactive find and replace (e.g. <code>s/foo/bar/gc</code>)</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Find and replace with regex (<code>s/^/-</code>)</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Find and replace with capture groups (e.g. <code>s/”\(.*\)”/\1/</code>)</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Command history (e.g. find and replace, search)</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Misc special actions, e.g. <code>g g</code>, <code>c f :</code>, <code>z z</code></td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Macros (with e.g. <code>q q</code>)</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total score possible</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It turned out, though, that three of these items - the first three on my list - were perfectly
implemented across my sample - every site that I tested was able to deliver these features. So, I
won&#8217;t discuss those points anymore. For every item from &#8220;visual block mode&#8221; on down, at least one
site or <span class="caps">IDE</span> that I tested, failed to deliver&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I tested the Vim modes of the following sites and&nbsp;IDEs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leetcode</li>
<li>Neetcode</li>
<li>Codesignal</li>
<li>Repl.it</li>
<li>Coderpad.io</li>
<li>HackerRank</li>
<li>Codewars.com</li>
<li>PyCharm with&nbsp;IdeaVim</li>
<li><span class="caps">VS</span> Code with&nbsp;vscodevim</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There was, satisfyingly, exactly one perfect score: Pycharm. Second place was a three-way tie
between applications that delivered every feature I tested, except for find and replace with capture
groups: repl.it, Codewars.com, and <span class="caps">VS</span> Code + vscodevim. The site that delivered the fewest Vim
features was&nbsp;HackerRank.</p>
<p>In a surprising number of cases, features were apparently present, but broken! For instance,
Leetcode appears to try to support macro recording and replaying - attempting to record a macro to
the &#8220;r&#8221; key with <code>q r</code> in Leetcode updates the mode line to read <code>--NORMAL--(recording)[r]</code>, and
closing the recording and, in some cases, executing it, all works as expected. But my default macro
test was to record a macro of myself typing &#8220;foo bar baz&#8221;, and Leetcode fails to record this as a
macro; instead it inserts only the last letter of the inserted&nbsp;string.</p>
<p>Here are the detailed results. (My tabular notes are
<a href="https://gist.github.com/BenQuigley/bde5e34798d8683eb0b3e24565656705">here</a> if you have a question
that&#8217;s not answered by the discussion&nbsp;below).</p>
<h3>Leetcode (22&nbsp;points)</h3>
<p>Delivered everything&nbsp;except:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive find and replace (e.g. <code>s/foo/bar/gc</code>) (which is supposed to open an interactive
  dialog where you answer <code>y / n / {other options}</code> for each replacement&nbsp;candidate).</li>
<li>Find and replace with capture groups (e.g. <code>s/"\(.*\)"/\1/</code> - this is supposed to store the
  replaced items for output, for example that expression would replace any string stored in quotes,
  with the string by&nbsp;itself).</li>
<li>Command history (e.g. find and replace, search, and other commands in Vim each store a history, so
  its same location in the text, but now in the middle of the window&nbsp;pane)</li>
<li>The special action <code>z z</code> (which is supposed to update the buffer location so that the cursor is at
  its same location in the text, but now in the middle of the window&nbsp;pane)</li>
<li>Macros (with e.g. <code>q q</code>). As I mentioned above, this is present but in a broken state on
  Leetcode.com as of right&nbsp;now.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Neetcode (23.5&nbsp;points)</h3>
<p>Delivered everything&nbsp;except:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find and replace with capture&nbsp;groups</li>
<li>Command&nbsp;history</li>
<li>The special action <code>z z</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Codesignal (23&nbsp;points)</h3>
<p>Delivered everything&nbsp;except:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive find and replace - the <code>s/foo/bar/gc</code> command did open a dialog, but it didn&#8217;t accept
  input on my machine, and the editor entered a broken&nbsp;state.</li>
<li>Find and replace with capture&nbsp;groups</li>
<li>Command&nbsp;history</li>
<li>The special action <code>z z</code></li>
<li>Macros</li>
</ul>
<h3>Repl.it (27&nbsp;points)</h3>
<p>Great result - delivered everything except find and replace with capture&nbsp;groups.</p>
<h3>Coderpad.io (21&nbsp;points)</h3>
<p>Delivered everything&nbsp;except:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jumping from a parenthesis to its partner with <code>%</code> - this worked in one direction, forwards, but
  not the other way&nbsp;around!</li>
<li>Interactive find and replace - like with Codesignal, the <code>s/foo/bar/gc</code> command did open a dialog
  but not a working one; unlike with Codesignal the dialog was at least exitable without reloading
  the entire&nbsp;page.</li>
<li>Find and replace with capture&nbsp;groups</li>
<li>Command&nbsp;history</li>
<li>The special action <code>z z</code></li>
<li>Macros</li>
</ul>
<h3>HackerRank (18&nbsp;points)</h3>
<p>Delivered everything&nbsp;except:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual block mode (interestingly, the only <span class="caps">IDE</span> I tested that did not deliver this - for reference,
  Ctrl + V enters a visual mode that&#8217;s distinct from both regular visual mode and linewise visual
  mode; where arbitrary rectangles of text can be selected and operated&nbsp;on).</li>
<li>Find and replace with <code>s/foo/bar</code> in Visual mode (<code>%s/foo/bar</code> replacements worked fine, so
  partial&nbsp;credit).</li>
<li>Interactive find and replace (instead launches a search; does not break page at&nbsp;all)</li>
<li>Find and replace with capture&nbsp;groups</li>
<li>Command&nbsp;history</li>
<li>The special action <code>z z</code></li>
<li>Macros</li>
</ul>
<h3>Codewars.com (27&nbsp;points)</h3>
<p>Same as repl.it, great result - delivered everything except find and replace with capture&nbsp;groups.</p>
<h3>PyCharm + IdeaVim (28&nbsp;points)</h3>
<p>The only perfect score! Everything I tested&nbsp;worked.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">VS</span> Code + vscodevim (27&nbsp;points)</h3>
<p>Same as repl.it and Codewars, great result - delivered everything except find and replace with capture&nbsp;groups.</p>
